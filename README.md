About

Side-Scrolling Platformer [Prototype] is a 2D action platformer project developed to explore character movement, obstacle interaction, and progressive level design. The game focuses on smooth player control, responsive jumping, and engaging level flow. My contributions include designing the movement system, implementing physics-based interactions, and developing the level progression framework.

Key Features

Responsive Controls: Smooth horizontal movement, jumping, and mid-air adjustments.

Obstacle Interaction: Collision-based physics for traps, platforms, and collectibles.

Level Progression: Structured stages with checkpoints and end-goals.

Simple Aesthetic: Clean visual design emphasizing clarity and flow.
